3. Restart Anki - this step is important - you must restart Anki for the add-ons to take effect.

4. Clone the this repository to your local HDD.

5. Using Anki, click "File" > "CrowdAnki: Import from disk" option and select a folder in this repo. Important: each folder in this repo represents a deck in Anki, so you'll need to perform this action for each deck you wish to import.
